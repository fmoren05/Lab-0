#Week 2, Lab 0 focuses on creating a CPython program that interfaces a desktop with a microcontroller through the USB-serial port, triggering and obtaining results from a step response test. The program's user interface includes three interactive buttons for test control which are "run test," "clear," and "quit". Data received from the microcontroller is processed in the CPython program, which converts character arrays to floating numbers and organizes them into lists. Finally, the example GUI program is modified to run the step response test which plots results using Matplotlib.
